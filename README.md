# SIM-Jacker
SIMJacker is a SIM card vulnerability discovered in 2019 that allows attackers to remotely execute commands on a victim‚Äôs mobile device by sending specially formatted OTA (over-the-air) SMS messages to the SIM card.

üß† How It Works:
It exploits the [SIM Toolkit (STK)] and S@T Browser (SIMalliance Toolbox Browser).

Attackers send a binary SMS containing S@T commands (like SETUP CALL, SEND USSD, SEND SMS, etc.).

These commands are processed silently by the SIM without notifying the user.

üì° Typical Payload Commands:
SETUP CALL ‚Äì Forces the phone to call a number.

SEND USSD ‚Äì Executes a USSD request (e.g., balance check).

SEND SMS ‚Äì Sends silent SMS messages.

PROVIDE LOCAL INFO ‚Äì Gets location or device info.

‚ö†Ô∏è Simjacker allows remote tracking, surveillance, and SIM-based control, often without user interaction or visible symptoms.
